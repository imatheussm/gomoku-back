# ![Gomoku](https://imatheussm.github.io/gomoku-front/assets/images/gomoku-logo.png)

A multiplayer server for the gomoku single-page application. You can see the single-page application working by [clicking here](https://imatheussm.github.io/gomoku-front/). The implementation of the gomoku front-end can be found by [clicking here](https://github.com/imatheussm/gomoku-front).

This application was developed by the following authors:
- Eduardo Gil S. Cardoso ([@ygarasab](https://github.com/ygarasab));
- Gabriela S. Maximino ([@gabrielamaximino](https://github.com/gabrielamaximino)); and
- Igor Matheus S. Moreira ([@imatheussm](https://github.com/imatheussm)).

## Requirements

The gomoku back-end mainly relies on [socket.io](https://socket.io/) to communicate with user endpoints and manage matches.
